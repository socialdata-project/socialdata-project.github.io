# Let's talk about it: men are 4 times more likely to commit suicide than women
### Men unalive themselves more than women in almost every country in the world and we need to know why

A study on suicide rates was conducted with data from the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org/). In this dataset, spanning from 2006 to 2019, the rates of death caused by self-harm were compared in all countries of the world.

An initial data analysis showed a declining trend throughout the years in all World Health Organization regions, although in different proportions. In Europe, for instance, this decrease is significantly faster than in the rest of the regions, followed by Africa, that is also experiencing a rapid reduction of suicide, even if it remains the region with the highes mean value. In the following line chart, you can visualize these patterns and see every region's average rate of suicides per year:

However, what all regions had in common is the fact that men commit suicide much more than women. In fact, in average, the rate for males is around 4 times that of women. What is more, when visualizing the male suicide rate against the female suicide rate per country we can see very clearly that the points conglomerate above the diagonal line that indicates a 1:1 ratio, showing that this rate is constantly higher in men:

Why is the proportion of male suicides much higher than that in women? Are men more likely to have mental health problems? Are men under much more pressure than women? Are men less likely to seek help? And more importantly, why isn't anyone talking about this?

Furthermore, when looking deeper, one can see that there is only one country in the entire world where there is a higher female rate. By hovering over this country, you can find Afghanistan, in the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean region. In fact, this region is the one closest to the 1:1 line, indicating that difference between suicide rates in men and women is lower in this part of the world. This sounds like great news, since there is less difference across sexes. However, after visualizing how the trends change throughout time across different age groups in Afghanistan, it is clear to see that in the early ages, men do commit more suicide than women and it is at 40 years old when the female rate starts to be consitently higher.

A further analysis was done inspired by a [UN article](https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/07/1121852) that explains how women in Afghanistan are commiting more suicide because of gender inequality. In this context, a possible explanation for an increase in suicide in Aghani women around the age of 40 can be domestic violence. In this additional study, data of gender violence from the [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development](https://data.oecd.org/inequality/violence-against-women.htm) (OECD) was used to compare a violence of index with the female to male suicide ratio.

Indeed, a correlation was found between this violence index and the women-men suicide ratio for all countries in the world. This was also calculated by region, being also visible in the Eastern Mediterranean region while in regions like Europe there was no correlation.

Therefore, the lower difference between male and female suicides in the Eastern Mediterranean region can be attributed to factors such as gender inequality and gender violence, which imply that women are committing more suicide, rather than men commiting less. 

On top of this, as it is clear in the rates per region line chart above, the Eastern Mediterranean region is the part of the world where less suicides happen. This difference might not be due to a lower number of deaths by self-harm, but perhaps due to a lack of reporting deaths as suicides. A likely reason for this is suicide being a taboo topic that people do not like to talk about, especially in men, which could result in less suicide reports and, even more, in less male suicide reports, making the male-to-female ratio smaller as seen above.

All in all, it is clear that men are committing suicide much more frequently than women in all regions of the planet. Regardless of whether men are under more pressure, are more likely to suffer from severe mental health conditions, or are less prone to ask for help, this is a global issue that we need to bring attention to and find a solution to prevent people from harming themselves.
